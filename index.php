<p align="center"><b>"Only in the darkness can you see stars" A quote from the legendary speaker Martin Luther King Jr. tells us that hope is realized in our darkest hours, and when we fall to the ground, we can choose whether or not, to get back up and stand through all the pain.
Yes... there will be times of trouble.Yes, there will be times of suffering, but when we find ourselves in the situation in our lives where we feel that darkness has consumed all of our dreams, and then, a speck of light shines upon us. That is hope. It will always be there... to guide us...  
Dear frontliners, I ask this of you, always remember that no matter what situation you are in, never raise the white flag because there are people who believe in you, people who have dreams to become better citizens of tomorrow. Please continue to help others, and have hope.  And to all of people who have reached rock-bottom, take the rope that is hope, and climb your way up again, in the mountain of life. Each of us matter in this world, and that is why we should lend a hand to the people who truly need it. Hope is there.</b>
